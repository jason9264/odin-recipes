    <h2> Steps </h2>
        <ol>
        <li> Combine lemon zest, juice, sugar and limoncello in a bowl. In another bowl, beat lemon curd and cream cheese with electric beaters until smooth. Beat in mascarpone.        </li>
        <li> Line a 1L loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving plenty overhanging. Dip 8 sponge fingers in the limoncello mixture, then use to line the base of the pan. Spread over half of the cream mixture. Repeat, then finish with a layer of sponge fingers. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze for 6 hours or overnight until set. </li>
        <li> Meanwhile, for the lemon syrup place sugar, 100ml water and lemon zest in a pan over medium heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then simmer for 5-6 minutes until slightly thickened. Transfer to a bowl and chill to cool and thicken. </li>
        <li> Place the semifreddo in the fridge to soften for 30 minutes before serving, then thickly slice and serve drizzled with syrup. </li>
        </ol>
